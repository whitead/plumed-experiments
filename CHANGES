New in version 1.1
* Features:
- Compatible with the domain-decomposition parallelization of GROMACS4.
- The bias can be interpolated using cubic splines on a grid
  (accelerates long metadynamics simulations with many hills).
- Sum over hills is parallelized on GROMACS and DLPOLY
  (accelerates long metadynamics simulations with many hills).
- More flexibility in the application of PBC to collective variable
  (useful for intramolecular coordinates).
- New directive ALIGN_ATOMS to work around codes which break molecules (such as GROMACS4 with some setup).
- Redesigned parallel tempering-metadynamics code, less memory required.
- Redesigned parser, with more error checking, plus a few features such as line continuation and NOTE keyword.
- Redesigned patching system, with more error checking.
- Output files are now opened once at the beginning of the simulation (more efficient, especially in replica
  exchange simulations where a huge number of files is opened in the same directory).
- Possibility of switching off metadynamics on a single variable by omitting the SIGMA flag.
- Driver: support to NPT runs with variable cell dimensions; number of CVs is now unlimited; pdb output name has a default when -interval is specified.
- Sum_hills has been parallelized.
* New collective variables:
- Electrostatic potential felt by a atom or group of atoms.
- Puckering variables (thanks to Marcello Sega).
* Bugs fixed:
- Parallel tempering-metadynamics and bias-exchange: fixed bug when using torsional collective variables.
- Fully compatible with particle-decomposition in GROMACS (it is not anymore necessary that all the
  particles involved in metadynamics are assigned to the first node).
- Driver: fixed bug when using a subset of the system atoms in the pdb.
