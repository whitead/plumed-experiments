In this directory we include some utilities: 

1) driver: a tool to calculate on a given trajectory file the value 
           of all the collective variables implemented in PLUMED;

2) sum_hills: a small piece of code that sums the Gaussians deposited during 
              a metadynamics simulation and returns back the free energy profile;

3) standalone: to run plumed as a standalone program; 

4) plumedat.sh: a script to parse the COLVAR file;

5) reweight: a tool to calculate the unbiased probability distribution of variables
             other than the CVs in well-tempered metadynamics simulations.

6) python-interface: python interface to use plumed together with ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment).

7) bias-exchange: a tool to perform bias-exchange simulations via the linux shell using every MD code.

For instruction on how to compile or use a specific utility, please refer to the
manual in the section "Postprocessing".
