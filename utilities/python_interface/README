Use the makefile to compile a library (libplumed.so) from the files in the common_files directory.

Remember to put the directory in which you compile the library in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable

Other than that, the tests should work out of the box. If not, try setting your $PYTHONPATH environment variable to 
the pylib directory. It should not be necessary, because I am setting it at runtime, but this could be 
system dependent, I am not completely sure.
